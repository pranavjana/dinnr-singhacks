## 📋 The Problem We're Solving

### Current State
- **Part 1**: External regulatory circulars are released continuously, imposing new AML surveillance rules that are difficult to track and implement consistently
- **Part 2**: Compliance teams perform manual, time-consuming checks on client corroboration documents with high error rates
- **Cross-functional friction**: Front, Compliance, and Legal teams struggle to detect risks in real-time due to information silos
- **High operational risk**: Manual processes lead to inconsistencies and potential regulatory violations

### What You're Building
- **Part 1: Real-Time AML Monitoring**
  - Continuously ingest external regulatory circulars and internal rule changes
  - Analyze client transactions and behaviors in real-time against regulatory requirements
  - Surface tailored alerts for Front and Compliance teams
  - Provide remediation workflows with audit trail maintenance

- **Part 2: Document & Image Corroboration**
  - Upload and process multiple file types: PDFs, text documents, and images
  - Detect formatting errors, spelling/grammar issues, and missing sections
  - Perform image integrity analysis (reverse search, AI-generated detection, tampering checks)
  - Provide real-time feedback and risk scoring for compliance officers

### Who Benefits
- **End users**: Operations and regulatory compliance employees
- **Front teams**: Relationship Managers with real-time risk alerts
- **Compliance teams**: Automated document verification and risk assessment
- **Legal teams**: Enhanced audit trails and regulatory compliance

## Provided Resources

### 1) `transactions_mock_1000_for_participants.csv` — **Part 1: Real-Time AML Monitoring**
A synthetic set of 1,000 transactions (jurisdiction, regulator, amounts, screening flags, SWIFT fields, etc.).  
Use it to prototype your rules engine, compute risk scores, and generate role-based alerts (Front/Compliance/Legal).

### 2) `Swiss_Home_Purchase_Agreement_Scanned_Noise_forparticipants.pdf` — **Part 2: Document & Image Corroboration**
A scanned client corroboration document for OCR and validation.  
Use it to extract fields, check formatting/consistency (amounts, dates, annexes, IDs), and produce a document risk score + findings list.

## 🏗️ Solution Components — Step-by-Step Build Guide

### Part 1: Real-Time AML Monitoring & Alerts

**What it does**: Continuously monitors regulatory changes and client transactions to detect AML risks in real-time.

**Key Components**:

#### 1. Regulatory Ingestion Engine
- **Crawl external sources**: MAS,FINMA, HKMA, and other regulatory bodies
- **Parse unstructured rules**: Convert regulatory circulars into actionable monitoring criteria
- **Version control**: Maintain audit trail of rule changes over time

#### 2. Transaction Analysis Engine
- **Real-time monitoring**: Analyze client transactions against current rules
- **Behavioral analysis**: Detect unusual patterns and suspicious activities
- **Risk scoring**: Assign risk scores based on multiple factors
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify complex money laundering schemes

#### 3. Alert System
- **Role-specific alerts**: Tailored notifications for Front, Compliance, and Legal teams
- **Priority routing**: High-risk alerts escalated immediately
- **Context provision**: Include relevant transaction history and regulatory context
- **Acknowledgment tracking**: Ensure alerts are reviewed and acted upon

#### 4. Remediation Workflows
- **Automated suggestions**: Recommend specific actions (enhanced due diligence, transaction blocking, escalation)
- **Workflow templates**: Pre-defined processes for common scenarios
- **Audit trail maintenance**: Record all actions taken for compliance defensibility
- **Integration capabilities**: Connect with existing compliance systems

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Working regulatory ingestion system
- [ ] Real-time transaction monitoring with configurable rules
- [ ] Alert system with role-based routing
- [ ] Remediation workflow engine
