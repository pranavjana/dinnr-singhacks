# Specification Quality Checklist: MAS AML/CFT Document Crawler

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Status**: PASSED ✓

All checklist items verified:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification avoids implementation details (no language/framework specifics). The spec is written for compliance officers and system architects, focusing on business value—collecting regulatory guidance for downstream LLM analysis.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 10 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) are clearly stated and testable. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers needed—the user description provided sufficient detail. Success criteria are all measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "90% PDF download success rate" vs. "use Python requests library").

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - **User Scenarios**: Four prioritized user stories (P1/P2) with independent test strategies
     - P1: Core crawling functionality (compliance officer collecting guidance)
     - P1: PDF downloads and local storage
     - P1: Structured output for LLM parsing
     - P2: FastAPI integration
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Each user story has 2-3 concrete acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format
   - **Edge Cases**: Five edge cases identified covering website unavailability, missing data, broken links, large files, and storage issues
   - **Success Criteria**: Eight measurable outcomes covering volume (10+ documents), quality (100% field consistency), performance (5-minute crawl), and robustness (90% PDF success, zero crashes)

4. **No Implementation Leakage**: Spec mentions "requests and BeautifulSoup" from user input but only as context—functional requirements don't mandate these tools. The key architectural guidance is "set of Python functions" and "FastAPI integration" which are integration patterns, not implementation details.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (3 critical P1 stories, 1 supporting P2)
- Comprehensive success criteria with both quantitative targets and qualitative measures
- Well-structured entities that capture both document metadata and session tracking
- Scope clearly bounded to avoid feature creep
- Detailed assumptions that help implementation without prescribing implementation approach

**Ready for next phase**: `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`
