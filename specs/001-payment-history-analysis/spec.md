# Feature Specification: Payment History Analysis Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-payment-history-analysis`
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "want to implement this: llm calls tool based on customer name ("originator_name"), ("originator_account"), recipient name ("beneficiary_name") and ("benefeciary_account"). It then fetches all relevant data from the csv as "payment history", which is then passed to the grok llm and then analysed along with "rules data", but the rules data is being worked on by someone else right now. Generate a plan for this."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-11-01

- Q: When multiple identifiers are provided (e.g., originator_name and beneficiary_account), should the system use AND logic (all must match) or OR logic (any can match)? → A: OR logic (union): Return transactions matching ANY of the provided identifiers for comprehensive coverage
- Q: What format should the LLM analysis output use (narrative text, structured data, tabular, or multi-section report)? → A: Structured JSON with risk scores, flagged transactions, and narrative summary (both machine and human readable)
- Q: When a single transaction matches multiple search criteria (e.g., same transaction_id matches both originator and beneficiary filters), should it appear once or multiple times in results? → A: Return unique transactions once (deduplicate by transaction_id)
- Q: How should the system handle name variations (exact match, case-insensitive, fuzzy, normalized)? → A: Exact match with case-insensitive search, but LLM analysis should flag similar names as potential anomalies (e.g., "Jennifer Parker" vs "J. Parker")
- Q: When the LLM service is temporarily unavailable, should the system fail the request, queue for retry, return data without analysis, or use fallback analysis? → A: Return retrieved data with error message (graceful degradation)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Query Payment History by Entity (Priority: P1)

Compliance officers need to retrieve complete payment history for specific customers or beneficiaries to investigate potential AML risks. By providing customer identifiers (names and account numbers), the system retrieves all relevant transaction records from the database.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables all downstream analysis. Without reliable data retrieval, no analysis can occur.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a known customer name/account number and verifying that all matching transactions are returned with correct filtering. Delivers immediate value by enabling manual review of payment histories.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a compliance officer has an originator name "Jennifer Parker", **When** they query the payment history, **Then** the system returns all transactions where this person is the originator
2. **Given** a specific beneficiary account number "GB88KUDJ48147748190437", **When** they query the payment history, **Then** the system returns all transactions sent to this account
3. **Given** both originator name "Jennifer Parker" and originator account "GB39OOLA52427580832378", **When** they query with both identifiers, **Then** the system returns all transactions where either originator_name="Jennifer Parker" OR originator_account="GB39OOLA52427580832378" (union of results)
4. **Given** multiple search criteria (originator name "Jennifer Parker" and beneficiary name "George Brown"), **When** they query the system, **Then** the system returns all transactions where originator_name="Jennifer Parker" OR beneficiary_name="George Brown" (comprehensive view of all activity involving either party)

### User Story 2 - LLM-Powered Risk Analysis (Priority: P2)

Once payment history is retrieved, compliance officers need AI-powered analysis to identify suspicious patterns, unusual behaviors, and potential AML red flags. The LLM analyzes transaction volumes, frequencies, jurisdictions, amounts, and other risk indicators to surface actionable insights.

**Why this priority**: Automates the manual analysis process that would otherwise take hours. Builds on P1 by adding intelligence to raw data.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by retrieving a known payment history and verifying that the LLM analysis output includes risk scoring, pattern identification, and specific flagged transactions. Delivers value by reducing analysis time from hours to seconds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a retrieved payment history for a customer, **When** the LLM analyzes the data, **Then** it identifies unusual transaction patterns (e.g., sudden volume spikes, round-number amounts, high-risk jurisdictions)
2. **Given** multiple transactions with suspicious characteristics, **When** analysis is performed, **Then** the LLM provides a risk score and explains the reasoning
3. **Given** a payment history with normal patterns, **When** analysis is performed, **Then** the LLM confirms no suspicious activity detected and provides supporting rationale
4. **Given** transactions involving high-risk jurisdictions or PEP (Politically Exposed Persons) flags, **When** analysis runs, **Then** these are explicitly highlighted in the output

---

### User Story 3 - Rules-Based Validation Integration (Priority: P3)

The system combines LLM analysis with regulatory rules (when available) to validate compliance against specific requirements from FINMA, HKMA, and MAS. Rules may include threshold limits, prohibited jurisdictions, required documentation, and transaction type restrictions.

**Why this priority**: Ensures compliance with regulatory requirements beyond pattern detection. Requires rules data from another team, making it dependent on external input.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing sample rules (e.g., "transactions over $500K to high-risk countries require enhanced due diligence") and verifying that the analysis flags violations. Delivers value by automating regulatory compliance checks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a rules database with threshold requirements, **When** payment history contains transactions exceeding thresholds, **Then** the system flags these for review
2. **Given** rules prohibiting certain jurisdictions without specific documentation, **When** transactions involve those jurisdictions, **Then** the system checks for required documentation and flags missing items
3. **Given** customer risk ratings and transaction rules, **When** high-risk customers perform transactions requiring additional checks, **Then** the system validates that required checks were performed
4. **Given** evolving regulatory rules, **When** new rules are added to the rules database, **Then** historical payment data can be re-analyzed against updated requirements

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a customer name appears with variations (e.g., "Jennifer Parker" vs "J. Parker" vs "Parker, Jennifer")? (Resolved: Query uses exact case-insensitive match; LLM flags similar names across transactions as anomalies)
- What happens when the same transaction matches multiple search criteria (e.g., internal transfer where originator and beneficiary both match search terms)? (Resolved: deduplicate by transaction_id)
- How does the system handle partial account numbers or typos in search queries?
- What happens when querying extremely active customers with thousands of transactions?
- How does the system respond when the LLM service is temporarily unavailable? (Resolved: Return retrieved data with error message - graceful degradation)
- What happens when transaction data contains null or missing fields (e.g., missing beneficiary_country)?
- How does the system handle concurrent queries from multiple compliance officers?
- What happens when rules data is not yet available (graceful degradation)?
