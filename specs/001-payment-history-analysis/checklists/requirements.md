# Specification Quality Checklist: Payment History Analysis Tool

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **Pass** - Specification is written in business language without technical implementation details. No mention of specific frameworks, languages, or technical architecture. Focuses on what the system must do for compliance officers.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **Pass** - All requirements are testable (e.g., FR-001 can be tested by querying with a known originator_name and verifying results). No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. Success criteria include specific metrics (5 seconds, 30 seconds, 90% accuracy, 100% recall, 40% reduction).

✅ **Pass** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "Compliance officers can retrieve complete payment history in under 5 seconds" - no mention of databases, APIs, or implementation).

✅ **Pass** - Edge cases comprehensively identified including name variations, partial data, high-volume scenarios, service availability, missing fields, concurrency, and graceful degradation.

✅ **Pass** - Scope clearly bounded: retrieval by 4 specific identifiers, LLM analysis with Grok, optional rules integration. External dependency (rules data) explicitly documented as P3 and gracefully degradable.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **Pass** - Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories. P1 covers FR-001 through FR-006, P2 covers FR-007 through FR-011, P3 covers FR-012 through FR-013.

✅ **Pass** - User scenarios prioritized and independently testable. P1 delivers immediate value (manual review of retrieved data), P2 adds automation (LLM analysis), P3 adds regulatory compliance (rules integration).

✅ **Pass** - Feature delivers all measurable outcomes: performance targets (SC-001, SC-002), accuracy targets (SC-003, SC-004), resilience (SC-005), effectiveness (SC-006), usability (SC-007), scalability (SC-008).

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, testable, and ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`.

### Strengths
- Clear prioritization enabling incremental delivery (P1 → P2 → P3)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- Well-defined external dependency (rules data) with graceful degradation strategy
- Complete entity model based on actual CSV schema

### No Issues Found
No specification updates required.
